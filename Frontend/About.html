                  <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Posture Guards is an innovative system that uses computer vision and
artificial intelligence (AI) to provide safe and efficient exercise monitoring
in real-time. The system uses a camera to capture the user's movements and
analyze them based on factors such as joint angles and range of motion.
Posture Guards provides accurate and objective measurements of exercise
performance, which can be used to optimize training and prevent injury.
In addition to monitoring exercise performance, Posture Guards also
includes safety features such as automatic detection of incorrect form or
potential injury risk. This can help users correct their form and reduce the
risk of injury, improving the overall safety and effectiveness of their
workouts. </p>

experience is not new. Fitness applications, wearable devices, and other
technological innovations have been developed in recent years to help
individuals track their fitness progress and achieve their fitness goals.<br>
          <br>&nbsp;According to a study conducted in 2014, knee injuries accounted
for the highest number of gym-related injuries at 23%, followed by injuries to
the ankle and foot at 16%, shoulder injuries at 14%, lower back injuries at
12%, and neck injuries at 11%. The remaining 22% included injuries to the
elbow, muscle strains, pulls and tears, and tendon ruptures. These injuries not
only cause physical discomfort but can also hinder the progress of the
individual's fitness journey.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The Posture Guards project aims to address these issues by
leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to create a
comprehensive workout solution that can help people reduce the risk of injuries
and achieve their fitness goals. The proposed solution will provide
personalized recommendations for workouts based on the user's fitness level and
injury risk, as well as real-time feedback on form and technique to prevent
injuries and ensure that the workouts are effective.

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-1"> Comparison
with Existing Software Solutions</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> To ensure that Posture Guards offers a comprehensive and competitive
solution, a comparison was made with several existing software solutions in the
field of fitness technology. The comparison focused on key features, such as
personalized workout plans, safety features, and real-time feedback.
One of the solutions that was compared with Posture Guards was
Fitbit, a popular wearable fitness tracker. While Fitbit offers basic activity
tracking and heart rate monitoring, it does not provide personalized workout
plans or real-time feedback on form or technique. In contrast, Posture Guards
offers advanced safety features, such as form analysis and personalized
feedback, to help users reduce the risk of injury and optimize their workouts.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; Another solution that was compared with Posture Guards was
MyFitnessPal, a mobile application that allows users to track their food intake
and exercise. While MyFitnessPal offers some basic workout tracking features,
it does not provide personalized workout plans or advanced safety features.
Posture Guards, on the other hand, offers personalized workout plans that are
tailored to an individual's specific fitness level, injury history, and goals,
as well as advanced safety features to ensure that users perform exercises with
proper form and technique.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; Finally, another solution that was compared with Posture Guards was
Mirror, an AI-powered workout assistant that uses computer vision to provide
real-time feedback on form and technique. While Mirror offers real-time
feedback, it does not provide personalized workout plans or advanced safety
features. Posture Guards, on the other hand, offers both personalized workout plans
and advanced safety features, as well as real-time feedback on form and
technique.
Through this comparison, it became clear that Posture Guards offers
a comprehensive and competitive solution that addresses key limitations of
existing software solutions in the field of fitness technology. By providing
personalized workout plans, advanced safety features, and real-time feedback,
Posture Guards can help users reduce the risk of injury and achieve their fitness
goals more effectively.&nbsp; .
