## Posture Guard - Gym Injury Prediction and Prevention

Abstract of the Project

Posture Guard â€“ Gym Injury Prediction and Prevention is an innovative system that utilizes computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor exercise performance and enhance safety in real-time. The system combines accurate movement analysis with automatic detection of incorrect form and potential injury risk, providing users with actionable feedback to optimize their workouts and reduce the risk of injury.

To further improve user experience, Posture Guard has recently introduced two new user interface (UI) options. The first is a UI developed using the Tkinter library for Python, which offers a seamless and intuitive desktop application. This UI allows users to navigate through different features, view exercise data, and receive real-time feedback on their performance. The interactive nature of the Tkinter-based UI enhances usability and accessibility, ensuring users can easily access and interpret their exercise metrics. In addition to the Tkinter UI, Posture Guard now offers a web-based UI developed with HTML and CSS. This web interface allows users to access Posture Guard from any device with a web browser, providing flexibility and convenience. The HTML and CSS-based UI features a visually appealing design that is responsive across different screen sizes. Users can monitor their exercise performance, review analytics, and receive feedback seamlessly through this intuitive 
web interface.

These new UI options cater to users with diverse preferences and accessibility needs, ensuring a user-friendly experience regardless of their device or interface preference. By combining advanced exercise monitoring capabilities with intuitive UI options, Posture Guard continues to revolutionize the fitness industry, empowering users to achieve their fitness goals safely and effectively.
